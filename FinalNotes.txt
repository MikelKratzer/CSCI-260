Final will be 10:00am Monday May 12th

40% from Multiple Choice - 35-40 questions

60% from Code Reading / Writing - 5-8 questions
    - Give code and ask what does this code do?
    e.g. plt.scatter(x,y,labels) -- +{creates} scatter plot ++{with data from} x and y
    - May give code from class with redacted sections, write in replacement
        minor syntax issues will not be graded
        if interpreter would catch it, not that big of issue
        note repetition when documenting

TOPICS:
    Processing data in general using Python 
        +csvreader (gaugeReader.py)
        for unnormalized data
    Spreadsheets
        usually first Normal from (1NF)
        some analysis can be done 
        not good when joining data together
    Database
        Does joins easily at cost of creating database
        psql install and start a psql server
            create database
            create appropriate user account
        IN PYTHON: install driver for database and then "connect" to database
            psycopg2 is the driver for postgres
            provide user account password and machine (localhost)
            need to get a cursor for the database  
                do queries: C reate -> Insert; R etreive -> Select; U pdate -> Update; D elete -> Delete
                    read or write changes to records themselves
                meta data queries: create table, index, alter table -- change data structure 
        Should be able to interpret select with maybe one join, including
            join
                select * from table1 join table2 on table1.field = table2.field
            domain aggregation (avg, count, etc.)
            formula (sqrt (distance in housing), etc.)
            where clauses (where id = 2, etc.)
            limit
        Insert syntax
            values keyword
            insert into table1 (id, first, last) values (1, "Mikel", "Kratzer"), (...);
        Update
            diffeent syntax compared to insert
            update table1 set id = 2 where last = "Kratzer";
        Rarely delete data
            caution: delete * from table; <-- never do (cannot be recovered without backup)
    Matplotlib -- install library
        Making plots (3D)
        Multiple charts on a single plot
        Put matplotlib plot on a tk interface
    TK Graphical User Interface (GUI) -- not a console
        add labels, buttons, combobox, etc.
        on some event, do some work (make a 3D K-NN plot, maintain single table, etc.)
