April 9, 10:00 am
40% Multiple Choice
    20 questions
60% Reading/Writing code
    4-5 questions
        "Fill in the blank" 
        e.g. Write an entire SQL statement, etc.
        Focus is SQL, Python is useful
Intent is to test on all content since last test
    GIVEN: Select, Insert, Delete, Update (simple form)
        Ability to create tables and look at structure
Using Python, build a useful USER INTERFACE for a database
    CLI (Command Line Interface)
        observe that we can separate database code from user interface code
            Model-View-Controller
        implement full CRUD operations
    Tk interface
        GUI (Graphical User Interface)
            event-based programming: hand over a function to be called when an event occurs (button clicks/action <Button-1>)
        Model-View-Controller
            single DB interface design could serve both a CLI and a GUI (--- web interface) to the database
    Matplotlib
        scatter plots mostly (easy)


WHAT DOES A QUESTION LOOK LIKE:
    As given in class, the add course button is created as below
    createButton = tk.Button(text = "Add Course", command = createui.createClick)
    And the code in createui.createClick is 
    def createClick(self):
        self.dialog = tk.Toplevel(self.parent)
        label = tk.Label(self.dialog, text= "_______________") WHAT TEXT GOES HERE?
        self.entry = tk.Entry(self.dialog, width = 10)

        add = tk.Button(self.dialog, text = "Add Course", command = self.click)
        cancel = tk.Button(self.dialog, text = "Cancel", command = self.dialog.destroy)
        
        label.pack()
        self.entry.pack()
        add.pack()
        cancel.pack()
        self.dialog.lift(self.parent)
